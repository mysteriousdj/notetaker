BootCamp Challenge - 11 Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description

To create a deployed heroku application that uses express.js to write notes. 

## Process 

Using the starter code, my task was the create a back end that connected the front end. I looked through lessons and assignments to understand what sections of code I need in order for the back end to work.
